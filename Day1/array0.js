// let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
// console.log(colors[1])

// let suppose we have to store five students marks


//  CASE:1
let mark1_s1 = 97;
let mark1_s2 = 45;
let mark1_s3= 86;
let mark1_s4 = 77;
let mark1_s5 = 72;

// this approach is not a ideal practical and real-world for storing a students data.
// • Repetition and Complexity
// • Code maintaining tough
// • Can't use Loop
// • Readability and scalability 


// CASE:2 
// we can create a objects
let marks = {
    s1:97,
    s2:68,
    s3:77,
    s4:89,
    s5:90
}

// This approach might be good in readability but especially when data in large scale 

// • difficult to loop 
// • if subject names change and dynamic have some issue.
// • no index-based access in objects
// • managing multiple students becomes complex.
